all files:
	.gitignore
	Makefile
	README

	arch/.gitignore
	arch/x86/*

	include/linux/*
	
	kernel/*
	
	os-project-2/*

(We only need to keep track of these files' changes in OS projects.)
(I use git to present file changes on Windows, edit the actual code and compile the whole kernel in VM.)
(I use "share folders" skill in this project; both Windows and Ubuntu are able to see this repository.)
